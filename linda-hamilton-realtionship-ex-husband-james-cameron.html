Chatting on The Graham Norton Show, which will air on Friday night, Linda admitted that she ignored James' phone calls until she realised he was calling about work. She explained: "We don’t talk at all. He rang three times and it was only on the third call when he mentioned it was about work that I rang him back! It took me a little while to decide if I had something more to do with her character." James and Linda married back in 1997, but split just two years later in 1999 with a £38million divorce settlement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a04283ff5ec7-linda-james-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=emdfXr7Y4nlQ data-wc=8><strong>Linda and James were married in the 90s</strong></p><p id=eDrBxDVVy0aW data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Avengers Endgame has taken over Titanic at the box office - see James Cameron's reaction</a></strong></p><p id=ekg-xD8V7NR5 data-wc=109>Linda has previously opened up about their split, telling The Lady magazine: "Titanic was the mistress he left me for. He was the kind of man who really would rather be at work with the mistress than at home with the wife. That was hard to come to terms with." She also opened up about their difficult marriage, adding; "It was terrible on every level. I wasn't ready, he wasn't ready. He was terribly insecure that I was going to ruin it for him somehow, which didn't make sense since I am an actress in my own right and had been in front of the camera. It was dreadful."</p><p id=eQZXKe7tjgYs data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins responds to James Cameron after he calls film 'a step backwards'</a></strong></p><p id=eWEP6BAn0ZCf><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/04664df75826-james-marriage-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p style=text-align:center id=ecaQUPUx4v24 data-wc=5><strong>The pair divorced in 1999</strong></p><p id=eULGqymD2rvc data-wc=66>Speaking about returning to the role of Sarah Connor in Terminator Dark Fate on the chat show, she said: "It took a lot of good hard work to get some level of fitness.
