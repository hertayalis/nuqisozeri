In the late 1980s, he worked for various Silicon Valley companies as a computer programmer and later moved to Beaverton, Oregon, to work for Sequent Computer Systems.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-311679 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Matt-Roloff.jpg alt width=900 height=601 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-311679 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Thos Robinson/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>"Little People, Big World" began airing on TLC on March 4, 2006, and as of this writing, it has aired more than 340 episodes over 21 seasons.

They welcomed fraternal twins Zachary and Jeremy in 1990, daughter Molly in 1993, and son Jacob in 1997. Zachary, like his mother, has achondroplasia, while the other three children are average height. On a March 2014 "Little People, Big World" special, Matt and Amy announced that after 26 years together, they had decided to try a trial separation, and they announced their impending divorce in June 2015. The Roloffs have been officially divorced since May 2016, and Matt began a relationship with Caryn Chandler, who served as his assistant for a decade, that year.</p><p>Roloff is president and co-founder of the Coalition for Dwarf Advocacy and the former president of Little People of America.

He completed an alcohol diversion program, and the charges were dropped. He was charged with DUI again in 2007 after a Washington County Sheriff's Deputy claimed that Matt drove outside the travel lane after he left a bar. Roloff said that he was having a hard time controlling the vehicle because it was fitted for Amy and that he was just dropping someone off at the bar. Matt pleaded not guilty, and the case was dismissed because of jury misconduct.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>As we mentioned earlier in this article, in 1990 Matt and Amy bought their first portion of what would eventually become a 109-acre property in Helvetia, Oregon. They paid $185,000 for the first parcel, eventually buying multiple neighboring parcels. They built a 4,500 square-foot primary home on the property while also eventually adding a number of unique attractions to the grounds. The grounds now include:</p><ul><li>Children's play castle the size of a small home</li><li>40 foot pirate ship that features several bedrooms</li><li>A replica western town featuring a jail, post office, bank and barbershop</li><li>Replica mountain range</li><li>3,600 square-foot barn</li></ul><p>Matt and Amy continued to co-own the property after their 2006 divorce but in 2019 Matt bought Amy out of her share.</p><p>In 2022 Matt put the primary 16-acre section of the property, featuring all of the above amenities, on the market for $4 million.
