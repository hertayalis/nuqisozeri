Despite putting in all his efforts, he couldn’t deliver. After RX 100, he is waiting for a solid comeback. Finally, he has teamed up with debutante director Clax for a periodic dramedy revolving around the Doomsday set in 2012. Will Kartikeya score a hit and end his flop saga? Here is the review of Bedurulanka 2012.</p><p><strong>What is it about?</strong></p><p>After leaving his unsatisfying computer graphics job in the city, Siva (Kartikeya) returns to his village named Bedurulanka and he is in love with the president’s daughter Chitra (Neha Shetty). As the news of Doomsday spreads like wildfire, fear grips the villagers. Bhushanam aka (Ajay Ghosh) hatches a conspiracy along with Brahmam (Srikanth Iyengar) and Daniel (Auto Ramprasad) to con people in the name of religion and fear. Will doomsday become reality? How Siva and his love with Chitra are linked to these? The film has answers for these questions.</p><p><strong>Performances</strong></p><p>For the first time in his career, Kartikeya slips into a satirical humour based character. This is an unexplored genre for him and effortlessly pulls it off. Neha Shetty plays a village belle and oozes her glamour when it’s necessary. She has got a character which comes with its own limitations and shines only when it comes to songs and romance. Ajay Ghosh (Bhushanam aka Bedurulanka Chiranjeevi) steals the show. Along with Srikanh Iyyengar (Brahmam) and Auto Ramprasad (Daniel), Ajay Ghosh generates great fun. These three characters take centre stage and help drive the story forward.</p><p>Goparaju Ramana too gets a decent role. Vennela Kishore, Satya and Getup Sreenu are occasionally seen in the latter half. They have short roles but are crucial for the film’s narration. The film involves a lot of side actors as the crowd in the village and have done their job.</p><p><strong>Technicalities</strong></p><p>Based on Yugantham (Doomsday), writer-director Clax manages to weave an interesting story in a fictional village. As a debutante director, he succeeds with his writing but not in execution. But the film has several grey areas where the maker could improve. Mani Sharma’s songs are okayish and demand more from the seasoned musician. However, he proves his mettle in the re-recording. Camera work needs a special appreciation. and the editing is alright.</p><p><strong>Thumbs Up</strong></p><p>Humour & Satire<br>Concept of Doomsday</p><p><strong>Thumbs Down</strong></p><p>Unwanted Songs<br>Draggy Portions<br>Predictable & Cinematic Elements</p><p><strong>Analysis</strong></p><p>Bedurulanka begins on a simple note and introduces the characters one after the other. Director Clax takes forever to establish the storyline. Once the key characters are introduced, the director brings in the lead pair’s romance which is weak. The end-of-age film has some sequences like Brahmam’s spirituality and Daniel’s pastor comedy have worked a bit.</p><p>One of the biggest drawbacks of the film is the runtime. There was no need to stretch the film for so long in the first half. The conflict is not clear in the beginning and the audience is clueless as what the main villains are up to in the first place. Things make sense only before the interval point when the hero starts his revolt. There are some savior moments in the latter portions. Kartikeya shows his true fan moment for Megastar Chiranjeevi as he boasts his love whenever he gets the opportunity.</p><p>The best thing in Bedurulanka is humour and an under-current message. Protagonist Siva raises pertinent questions against the superstitions. He sheds light on the cheating that is going on in the name of God and religion. The film struggles with its pace. It drags at some portions and it moves hastily at times. Towards the climax, the film is rushed. There are cinematic liberties which are conveniently taken. As the film progresses, it becomes quite predictable.</p><p>Writer-director Clax could have worked on these loopholes. Even the unwanted songs which obstruct the film’s flow could have been avoided. The makers have under-utilised some of the film’s strengths. The film lacks the thrill as one could guess the future proceedings.</p><p>Dialogues are well-written. Some of the dialogues involving God and religion may not go down well with the theists. Some may be intentional and others may be unintentional. There is good dose of profanity squandered here and there using double entendre.</p><p>Remember Akira Kurosawa’s cult classic movie Seven Samurai and its popular dialogue? “When we say there is no tomorrow, we don’t care what society thinks?” This dialogue exactly becomes the source for Bedurulanka’s interesting climax but it is exaggerated for no reason. The last songs in the climax is so over the top that you do not understand the logic behind it. On the whole, Bedurulanka connects all the dots and joins the missing links in the end, but leaves one with mixed feelings. It could be better? Well, certainly yes.</p><p>The confession scenes of the villagers could have been pictured well. The pre-climax and climax sequences make for an interesting ending. However, all this does not happen and Bedurulanka leaves viewers with a feeling of letdown. In a way it is a good story spoilt by some silly narration.</p><p><strong>Verdict: Badly Executed Doomsday!</strong></p><p><strong>Rating: 2/5</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qMHLrZxnm5%2BifK671aKcq52mnrK4v45rbG9oaGh8o7HDrqmupJGjuKJ5kWloa2WdpMOqsYyrnK%2Bhlaw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alienware-refreshes-the-alienware-15-and-17-gaming-notebooks-at-pax.html><span>←</span><span>Alienware Refreshes The Alienware 15 And 17 Gaming Notebooks At PAX</span></a>
