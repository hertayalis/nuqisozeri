Meanwhile the actor, 35, looked sharp in a three-piece Ralph Lauren suit. When it came to the star's dress, she felt like she could take over the world.</p><p id=e4egsAnb9Pge data-wc=90>"I’d never been someone who imagined my wedding dress as a little girl or even, truthfully, four months before the wedding!" she revealed. "I found myself gravitating toward really simple designs. I finally settled on these two pieces by Cortana because I could wear the silk top again. The bottom was a corseted, big dress. Some women say, 'I feel like when I put on the right pair of shoes, I can take on the world' – when they laced me up in this dress, I had that same feeling."</p><p style=text-align:center id=eTRK-uqcBA6I><strong></strong></p><p style=text-align:center id=elYJHKvgk_TL><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9d8dfc123bd7-body53-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><strong>Troian and Patrick had a rustic wedding outdoors</strong> <strong></strong>Photo: Max Wanger<p id=eT0QcKASUK4A data-wc=56>The couple was wed by playwright BillCain, the man responsible for bringing them together in the first place when they met in 2009 starring in his play and exchanged their vows in front of 200 "campers" including <strong>Chris Pine</strong>, <strong>Zachary Quinto</strong>, <strong>Gabriel Macht</strong>, <strong>Sarah Rafferty</strong>, <strong>Lucy Hale</strong>, <strong>Ashley Benson, Tyler Blackburn, Keegan Allen </strong>and <strong>Lulu Brud</strong>.</p><p id=eBjbCY9pVzxA data-wc=47>"Our dream was to have a weekend that not just celebrated our wedding but celebrated and thanked our incredible community of friends and family that have been so instrumental in helping us survive seven years of a long distance relationship," the couple added<strong> </strong>of their special day.</p><p id=ehg8KuAXAfJ1 data-wc=42>They continued: "It had really been the most powerful, transcendent, hilarious, joyful and emotional weekend of our lives.
