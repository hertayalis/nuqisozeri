<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Her Age, Mother &amp;amp; Bio</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Isabella Pujols</strong> is the famous celebrity daughter of American baseball player <strong>Albert Pujols</strong>. Her family rose to fame after her father became one of the prominent baseball hitters in Major League Baseball.</p><p>The young girl is also in the limelight for being <strong>adopted </strong>and born with Down's Syndrome. Despite her struggles and differences, Isabella is always positive and has been a valued member of the Pujols clan.</p><h2>Isabella Has Down's Syndrome</h2><p>When she was born, Isabella Pujols was <strong>diagnosed </strong>with Trisomy 21 genetic disorder, better known as Down's Syndrome. The condition has been prevalent worldwide for a long time and is very widely present.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/21/Twitters%20(1)-1671621535231.jpg><p>Because of this diagnosis, Isabella's mother, Deidre, and her family did not neglect Isabella. They have showered her with love and affection and even established charities to create more awareness about the situation.</p><h2>Isabella Was Born To A Single Mother</h2><p>Isabella was born in <strong>1999 </strong>to <strong>Deidre Corona </strong>when she was just twenty-one years of age. As a single mother, Deidre was pretty overwhelmed, but she had the support of her parents, Michael and Annette Corona. All that would change when she met her future husband, Albert Pujols.</p><p>When aware of the situation, Albert was willing to accept baby Isabella with open arms. He even gave the baby girl his surname and has always cherished his role as her father.</p><h2>Isabella Pujols Is Adopted&nbsp;</h2><p>Isabella Pujols is an adopted child, just like <a href=#><strong>Jamyan McGregor</strong></a>. Albert’s ex-wife Deidre had Isabella from a previous relationship a year before she met him. However, after they married, Albert Pujols officially <strong>adopted </strong>Isabella and has since been treating and referring to her as his child.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, nothing is known about Isabella’s biological father, whose identity has remained a <strong>secret</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/21/fbb%20(1)-1671621356804.jpg><p>Isabella was born with Down's syndrome, and her condition inspired her father, Albert, to set up a <strong>foundation </strong>– The Pujols Family Foundation, in 2005. The nonprofit organization, which Albert runs with his ex-wife, is dedicated to helping individuals with Down <strong>syndrome </strong>in the Dominican Republic improve their quality of life.</p><p>A lot of information about Isabella is scarce in the media. So, what career path she is on is yet to be known. However, considering her age, Isabella must have been through with acquiring her first degree.</p><h2>Has Four Younger Half Siblings</h2><p>Isabella Pujols is an older sister to <strong>four </strong>kids: Sophia Pujols, Esther Grace Pujols, <a href=#><strong>Ezra Pujols</strong></a>, and Albert Pujols Jr. They are technically her <strong>half-siblings</strong> and were born during her parents' marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/21/godreports%20(1)-1671646911019.jpg><p>After two years of marriage, in <strong>2002</strong>, Albert and Didi had their second child, Albert Jr, a college student. The remaining three children are technically minors, and custody has not yet been decided. Sophia was born in 2005, followed by Ezra in 2010, and the youngest, Esther, in 2012.</p><h2>Net Worth of Isabella's&nbsp;Father, Albert Pujols</h2><p>Isabella Pujols's family has greatly benefitted from her father's successful Major League Baseball career. Albert Pujols's net worth is estimated to be a cool <strong>$170 million</strong>. He earned about <strong>$30 million</strong> from his baseball career in 2022 alone.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Albert also earns around eight figures from his contracts and other endorsements. He recently created his own cereal brand with much success.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/21/albert%20(1)-1671645998045.jpg><p>Albert has been very generous with his <strong>money </strong>and dedicates a chunk of it to <strong>charities</strong>. He also funds the Pujols Family Foundation, which raises awareness on the topic of Down's Syndrome and supports the struggling people of the Dominican Republic.</p><h2>Isabella's&nbsp;Father Is Active On Social Media</h2><p>Albert Pujols has been pretty active on social media with a specific fan base. His Instagram handle <a href=# rel=nofollow>@albertpujols</a> has about <strong>350K </strong>followers, and his Twitter account <a href=# rel=nofollow>@PujolsFive</a> has <strong>270K </strong>followers.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Albert&nbsp;also has his own website @<i>albertpujols.com</i>, which redirects to his charity page, <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Pujols Foundation</a>. His most popular platform is his <a href=# rel=nofollow>Facebook account</a>, with about 670K followers.&nbsp;</p><h2>Isabella's&nbsp;Mother Had Surgery For a Brain Tumor</h2><p>Isabella's mother, Deidre, has <strong>surgery</strong> for a brain tumor in April of 2022. She was <strong>diagnosed </strong>in October of 2021 and waited until April to have the surgery. Her family members accompanied Deidre to California, where she was treated.&nbsp;</p><p>Deidre's surgery recovery was plagued with news of her husband filing for divorce. They had been <strong>allegedly </strong>separated in February of 2022. This cast a shadow on Pujols's final baseball season, and Deidre's Instagram page, @DeidrePujolsAdventures, is now deleted.&nbsp;</p><h2>A Quick Look At Isabella's&nbsp;Parent's Divorce</h2><p>After twenty-two years together, Albert Pujols and Deidre Pujols filed for <strong>divorce </strong>in April of 2022. The pair split up, citing irreconcilable differences in February, and divorce was the next step similar to that of <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Sharon Logonov</strong></a>. This was a new aspect as both parties were deeply religious.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/21/opengateintl%20(1)-1671646077128.jpg><p>The divorce has not been finalized but has come under heavy scrutiny as Albert announced the divorce just as Deidre had gotten surgery for a brain tumor and was in recovery. Reports suggest that the process has gotten <strong>messy</strong>, and Albert has already moved on to another woman.&nbsp;</p><h2>More About Isabella's&nbsp;Father Albert Pujols</h2><p>Born in the Dominican Republic on <strong>January 16, 1980</strong>, Albert moved to the United States in 1996 with his family. There he performed admirably in High School baseball games and was even given a sports <strong>scholarship </strong>to Maple Woods Community College. Later after getting great reviews, he was drafted into MLB in 1999.</p><p>Albert started playing in the big leagues in <strong>2001 </strong>when he was just twenty-one years of age, and he pulled the St. Louis Cardinals to a World Series victory in <strong>2004</strong>. Since then, he has been one of the top contenders for MVP in the seasons. He was also <strong>awarded </strong>The Player of the Decade honor by The Sporting News and Sports Illustrated magazines.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Albert&nbsp;played his last season in 2022, ten years after <a href=# rel=nofollow>Chipper Jones</a>, who is also an MLB legend. Moreover, he was <strong>cheered </strong>on by his children. Experts say that he will be inducted into the '<strong>Baseball Hall of Fame</strong>' as soon as he is eligible. &nbsp;</p><h2>What Is Isabella Doing Now?</h2><p>Isabella Pujols lives a quiet private life, possibly due to her diagnosis. Her mother, Deidre, has asked for financial support for Isabella in her divorce filings.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, she is living with her mother because of a dispute between her parents. Many who know Isabella and her condition are rooting for her happiness.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>For more interesting articles, visit our site, </strong></i><a href=# rel=nofollow><i><strong>Married Celeb.</strong></i></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqKqmpqVobmiec%2Buoaikow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dolly-parton-feminist.html><span>←</span><span>Dolly Parton Explained Her Unique Stance on Feminism</span></a>
