It is easy to see why as well. The story about the fictional President's son Alex who falls madly in love with the English Prince Henry is the most romantic beach read, and Casey told HELLO! that she was "blown away" by the response the book has had.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3b4f7fb64125-red-white-rblue-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=egfYcOY5JF0a data-wc=6><strong>The book quickly became a bestseller</strong></p><p id=eVBUtP61Kc10 data-wc=124>She said: I feel so incredibly lucky to have written something that's resonated with so many people on so many levels. I expected this book to do well if it could find its target audience of queer millennials looking for a fun and escapist rom-com, but I never expected it to transcend as much as it has." She also opened up about a potential sequel based on the boys, explaining that although she wasn't working on it at the moment, "anything's possible". She said: "I will say that I have plenty of ideas for stories set in this world and would love a chance to explore one of them some day. I would be surprised if you've seen the last of Alex and Henry."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on X</a><p id=eSic3FN26StV data-wc=91>The novel has already been picked up by Amazon Studios, and Casey revealed the very early plans for a film to be made. "The teams at Berlanti Productions and Amazon Studios have so much love for this project and are dedicating so much care to making sure it’s done right," she said. "Right now the plan is a movie, something big and shiny and colorful in the key of Love, Simon and Crazy Rich Asians. It will be gorgeous and stylish and funny and as true to the book as possible!"</p><p id=eQuHxi5Wurh_ data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Why Red, White and Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston is about to become your new obsession</a></strong></p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on X</a><p id=eIW82gl1XjtR data-wc=50>She also opened up about her second novel, which is based on a "cynical, prickly loner" who falls in love with a mysterious woman in NYC.
