We were two kids out of Menlo-Atherton High School,” she said in a television interview, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Far Out</a>. “I loved him for all the right reasons. We did have a great relationship at first. I loved taking care of him and the house.”</p><p id=par-5_27>Mick Fleetwood invited Buckingham to join his <a href=#>classic rock</a> band as a guitarist, but Buckingham said he and Nicks were a package deal, so they both joined.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_46>The couple already had issues upon joining Fleetwood Mac but was determined to make the relationship work. However, they hit a particularly rough patch while making Rumours. “Dreams,” penned by Nicks, and “Go Your Own Way,” by Buckingham, were about the final days of their relationship.</p><p id=par-7_56>Nicks said the band came first to both of them. “But Lindsey always blamed Fleetwood Mac for the loss of me,” she said. “Had we not joined Fleetwood Mac, we would’ve continued on with our music, but we probably would’ve gotten married, and we probably would’ve had a child. It would have been a different life.”</p><h2 id=h-why-did-a-psychologist-tell-stevie-nicks-that-joining-fleetwood-mac-was-her-saddest-day>Why did a psychologist tell Stevie Nicks that joining Fleetwood Mac was her ‘saddest day’?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Stevie-Nicks-Fleetwood-Mac-1.jpg><p id=par-8_22>The “Rhiannon” singer is a self-proclaimed caretaker.

Nicks recalled the psychologist told her, “I think that you sound like you really are a caretaker.” Nicks agreed, saying she loves “making sure the bed is beautifully made” and caring for people when they’re sick.</p><p id=par-11_44>The psychologist added, “I think that the day you joined Fleetwood Mac was the saddest day of your life in many ways because a lot of the things that you love to do, which is to take care of people, ended on that day.”</p><p id=par-12_7>Nicks said the psychologist was spot on.</p><h2 id=h-nicks-pursued-a-successful-solo-career>Nicks pursued a successful solo career</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-13_23>Stevie Nicks launched her solo career in 1981 with the chart-topping album Bella Donna.

We argue all the time, but we always have. In my band, there is no arguing. I am the boss,” Nicks told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a> in 2016. “My solo career is probably the reason Fleetwood Mac is still together in 2016, because I was always happy to leave Fleetwood Mac, and I was always happy to come back, too.”</p><p id=par-16_30>Nicks was the first woman to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame twice, first with Fleetwood Mac in 1998 and as a solo artist in 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9tMXCoaalp5eewLV506ijnWWjqbK3tcRmpaKbm6h6q7vIp6Cnn12buaax07CmqJxdoq6kedKam52do6l6pa3YZ5%2BtpZxk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tuface-idibia-and-pero-react-as-troll-leaves-inappropriate-comment-on-their-sons-page.html><span>←</span><span>Tuface Idibia and Pero react as troll leaves inappropriate comment on their son's page</span></a>
