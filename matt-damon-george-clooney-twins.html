Although Clooney, 55, tried to compare their experiences of fatherhood, Damon, 46, pointed out that having four kids and having twins are not exactly the same. "He said to me, he was like, 'Well you have four,' and I said, 'Yeah, but not at once.' We did it one at a time," he joked.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While Clooney, is expecting his first children, Damon and his other friends either already have a child in college or are about to send one off to school. "All of those guys, their kids are either in college or on their way, and now George is getting started. So it's good, it's pretty funny. I think they're having a good time with him."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If the baby news means we'll see some Clooney-Damon dad dates in the future, we are here for it.
