Plenty of words have been spilled about Betts’ comfort in Los Angeles, how he has embraced this version of himself and what that has all meant to a team that has leaned on him more than ever.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>He has put together a compelling case to win National League MVP.</p><p>Betts said it took time to admit to himself his offensive profile has changed. He has always thought of himself as the prototypical leadoff hitter, emphasizing getting on base and stealing bases to help lead to the run producers behind him. Now, he has become one himself.</p><p>He has already set a career high with 39 home runs and now has found himself in the record books for his ability to not just score runs at will, but drive them in as well. — Ardaya</p><h2>What they’re saying</h2><p>“It seems like every night, we’re eclipsing milestones as individuals and you know Mookie’s season is dang near unprecedented from the leadoff spot,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “There’s been a lot of great leadoff hitters, and for him to be No. 1 is pretty remarkable. And then you layer in the defense and what he does so how he wouldn’t be at the top of the MVP conversation is beside me.”</p><h2>Backstory</h2><p>Betts, 30, has eight regular-season games left to try to tie his personal record of 113 RBIs in one season, which came with the Red Sox in 2016.</p><h2>Required reading</h2><p>(Photo: Gary A.
