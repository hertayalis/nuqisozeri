The crash claimed the lives of 117 passengers, and because of the location — and the weather — the entire thing was never recovered. In the years since the crash, bits and pieces of the wreckage and cargo have been found. After the overwhelmingly honest climber turned the jewels over the authorities, they began to look for the rightful owner amid a veil of secrecy. Nothing can be easy, and two different families claimed the box was theirs. Hey, at least the finder has a serious chunk of good karma coming his way, right?</p><p>That isn't the only treasure still on the mountain. In 2014, <a href=#>The Telegraph</a> reported that a French treasure hunter named Daniel Roche found 50 pieces of jewelry that had emerged from the glacier. Ready to <a href=#>become a treasure hunter</a>&nbsp;yet?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDlmtsbGeSnseivtGeZK2gmaO0tHnFqKynnF2bv7DGxKdkopuVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-best-tv-shows-like-suits.html><span>←</span><span>The 10 best TV shows like Suits</span></a>
