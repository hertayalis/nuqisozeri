But the murder wasn't necessarily some great conspiracy. Remember Harold Christie? He might not have been so innocent after all. It is suspected that Christie owed Oakes a lot of money, and with Oakes planning to move to Mexico, he was expecting Christie to repay his debts. So, Christie had Oakes murdered and tried to burn down the whole house as a result, but failed to do so, and pretended to have walked in on the crime scene, according to <a href=#>The Guardian</a>. In fact, a witness stated they saw Christie outside next to a boat the night of Oakes' murder, unlike Christie's story where he was staying the night, according to <a href=#>Crime Investigation</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>But what about the Duke of Windsor? Why would he want to cover up the murder? According to this theory, the former king might've been embarrassed that this even happened under his watch, given his already negative reputation (via The Guardian). As for Christie, he went on to become a very wealthy man through property development in the Bahamas, and even though the murder has never been officially resolved, this story sounds so simple that it may just be the truth after all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFlWxqbG5fqbWmedKiqWagkae%2FunnOmqKeq12ptaa70bJkraCRqXq4u9Slm2abmJa7qLGMnq2eqqmptaq6xmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-oldest-classic-rock-icons-that-are-still-alive-today.html><span>←</span><span>The Oldest Classic Rock Icons That Are Still Alive Today</span></a>
