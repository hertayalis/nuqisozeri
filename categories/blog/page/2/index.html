<a href=../../../../143000-the-to-kill-a-mockingbird-court-room-scene-is-worth-a-rewatch-in-harper-lees-memory.html></a>
I've wanted to grow up to be like Harper Lee ever since the moment I was first introduced to her writing as a kid, so Harper Lee's death at 89 hits me right in the gut. The only surefire way I've found of dealing with these kinds of sucker punches is to celebrate the lives of the person whose death has devastated me. That's why I think every fan can benefit from watching the most memorable scene from To Kill A Mockingbird one more time, especially if it's been a while.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Tim Mcenery Net Worth 2024</h2><time>Sep 7, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../the-mohel.html></a>
The first mohel (usually pronounced so it rhymes with “boil”) was a 99-year-old ex-shepherd with no medical training whatsoever. There is no record of how he performed the procedure but, given that he was his own first subject, it is unlikely that Abraham used an anesthetic.
Things have changed since then. Circumcision is probably the best-known indication of Jewishness in a male (if not the most immediately visible!). It is also the oldest and one of the most widely followed of Jewish ritual practices.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Aaron Goodwin Net Worth 2024</h2><time>Sep 6, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../correcting-a9s-l3-cache.html></a>
Along with today’s analysis of Chipworks’ A9X die shot, I’m also going to use this time to revisit Apple’s A9 SoC. Based on some new information from Chipworks and some additional internal test data, I am issuing a correction to our original analysis of Apple’s latest-generation phone SoC.
In our original analysis of the A9, I wrote that the L3 cache was 8MB. This was based upon our initial tests along with Chipworks’ own analysis of the physical layout of the A9, which pointed to an 8MB L3 cache.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Display Analysis - Google Nexus 4 Review</h2><time>Sep 6, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../google-nexus-4-review.html></a>
The display on the Nexus 4 is another shared component between the Optimus G, and is a 4.7-inch IPS WXGA (1280x768) LCD, which is of course home to an RGB stripe and in-cell touch, or as LG calls it, "zerogap" touch. LG Display unsurprisingly knows how to make LCD displays, and the Nexus 4 display looks subjectively very good. At 320 PPI I can’t see any pixels, and don’t think we need to get into the whole visual acuity discussion again, it’s very good on the Nexus 4.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Latest Yellowstone News: 1923 reveals 2 Dutton family members fates as Aminah Nieves</h2><time>Sep 6, 2024</time>
