Kendall Jenner's latest off-duty look goes back to the basics.
Earlier this week, the reality TV star and model stepped out wearing an iteration of one of her classic summer uniforms.

Jenner styled the look with this season's most covetable shoe option: the kitten heel. Her take on the trend involved an ivory pair resembling ballet flats and featuring the signature mini heels.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Princess Eugenie Debuts a Tiny Circle Ear TattooSee Photos</h2><time>Jun 8, 2024</time>
