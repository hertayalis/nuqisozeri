He began his career touring with 2 Live Crew’s Fresh Kid Ice as a teenager and went on to appear on high-profile mixtapes, notably DJ Khaled’s “We the Best on Bitch I’m from Dade County,” alongside artists such as Rick Ross, Trick Daddy, Trina, and Dre.

The contract promised him bonuses and stock options if certain sales milestones were achieved. In a lawsuit filed in 2021, Flo Rida claimed the contract entitled him to 500,000 shares by default and an additional 250,000 shares if various sales units were achieved. The contract was reportedly vague and did not give a timeline for milestones to be hit or define what a unit was.</p><p>Flo Rida’s lawyers argued that their client wasn’t given access to Celsius’ financial performance, so he wasn’t able to understand if, how and when any milestones were surpassed. On January 19, 2023, a civil jury found in favor of Flo Rida and ordered Celsius to pay him $82.6 million in damages.</p><h2><span id=Flo_Ridas_Early_Life>Flo Rida’s Early Life</span></h2><p>Flo Rida, born Tramar Lacel Dillard on September 16th, 1979, grew up in Carol City, Florida.
