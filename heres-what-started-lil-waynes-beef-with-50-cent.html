Since their beef, the two rappers have occasionally socialized with each other. In October 2012, 50 sent well wishes to Lil Wayne after he suffered two seizures on a plane, as per <a href=#>Variety</a>. In the now-deleted tweet (via <a href=#>LilWayneHQ</a>), 50 tweeted, "@liltunechi damn a seizure,try to get some rest man don't kill your self [sic]."</p><p>Since the end of their beef, 50 and Lil Wayne have been spotted hanging out with one another. Early in 2020, the two rappers had an overdue conversation with one another on Young Money Radio, per <a href=#>ThisIs50</a>. The two stars covered their early successes, as well as the success of 50 Cent's rap collection, G-Unit. Throughout the <a href=#>chat</a>, Lil Wayne and 50 Cent shared a few laughs with one another.</p><p>Even though their beef seemed to be prolonged, the two rappers have reached a common ground and put their differences aside. Both respected in the hip-hop industry, it's great to see the pair reunited and proudly waving their white flags in a truce.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma21oZoR1e8eeqZ6rXay1osCMrKuaqqSasW64yKVksJmpo7K0ecGenJ9lp57BqXmUaWScnZ6pfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./samsung-galaxy-tab-s-review-105-84inch.html><span>←</span><span>Final Words - Samsung Galaxy Tab S Review (10.5 &amp;amp; 8.4-inch)</span></a>
