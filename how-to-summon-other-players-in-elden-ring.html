Gold summon signs are allies you can summon into your world to help you defeat enemies like bosses. To summon these allies, you first need to find or craft Furlcalling Finger Remedy. This item is dropped by invaders and can be crafted using two Erdleaf Flowers. Use it near a summoning pool to make summon signs appear.</p><p>Red summon signs are for when you want to face another player in battle. You will be able to find these signs around summoning pools as well. Summoning a player of this type will cause them to glow red. You will then be able to deal damage to them and vice versa. You will get rewarded for defeating the player. You can also summon other players by creating a password. This is done by going to the menu, selecting multiplayer, and setting up the password in the sub-menu.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11e9a45e40b14c0e4d8f16797fb96145?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Aden Carter</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Aden Carter is a freelance writer for Gamepur who loves RPGs, and isn't afraid to face the most difficult of bosses.
