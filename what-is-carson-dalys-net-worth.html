That property encompasses two side-by-side houses, and Daly reportedly combined the adjoining backyards to create one large lawn and pool area.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>Daly’s two properties are estimated to be worth around $20 million combined, accounting for much of his $50 million fortune.
