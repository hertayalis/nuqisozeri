Grey’s Anatomy alum Jesse Williams, who made his Broadway debut in Take Me Out in 2022, wasn’t afraid to wear his birthday suit for the sake of the story.</p><p>“If somebody had just said it’s a play with nudity, it would have been framed differently,” he told the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Associated Press</a>. “But the nudity is honest. It makes sense. It’s not salacious. It serves the story. It puts the audience in an interesting position to relate to and empathize with the characters.”</p><p>Whether it’s to enhance to story of a play, or the performance as a band (we’re looking at you, Blink-182 and Red Hot Chilli Peppers), many celebrities have bared it all in front of a live audience.

She told the now archived magazine Now Magazine per <a href=#>Digital Spy</a> in 2010, “I just think it was done so tastefully. It wasn’t until I came back to see the show [once I’d left] that I was like, ‘Oh my God, I did that every single night.'” Michelle starred alongside Glee alum Jonathan Groff in the smash-hit Broadway play.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.95867768595041><h2>Ian McKellen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/celebrity-naked-broadway4.jpg><p>The legendary <a href=#>Sir</a> Ian McKellan went full-frontal nude in the 2007 Broadway production of King Lear.

She and actor Keith Mitchell stripped down for a passionate love scene, but Rigg received a lot of flak for it. She told <a href=#>Daily Mail,</a> “I was the first major actress to get my knickers down. The reaction was horrible. I did one of the first nude scenes and I got one of the meanest, nastiest notices ever known.” She also added that a critic had the nerve to comment on her breasts, ‘An American critic wrote ‘Diana Rigg is built like a brick mausoleum with insufficient flying buttresses.'”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.98214285714286><h2>Audra McDonald</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/celebrity-naked-broadway6.jpg><p>Audra McDonald starred in the Broadway play Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune 2019 and in the opening scene, she and Michael Shannon performed a nude simulated sex scene.
