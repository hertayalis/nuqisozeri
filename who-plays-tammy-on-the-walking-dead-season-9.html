Who is Earl? These are questions that fans of the show are asking about the second episode of the new season.</p><p>During the season premiere, <a href=#>Ken perished during an attack from walkers</a>. Ken was a resident of Hilltop and had worked as a stable boy for a while. He wouldn’t be considered a main character on the show, but his story is going to become an important one.</p><p>Ken’s parents debuted when Maggie Greene went to tell them the news about their son. This was when the characters of Tammy Rose and Earl first made their debuts for The Walking Dead audience.</p><h2>Who plays Tammy on The Walking Dead?</h2><p>If Tammy seems very recognizable, it is because she is a veteran of television. Brett Butler is Tammy Rose.</p><p>The actress is best-known for her starring role on Grace Under Fire. She was nominated for several television awards during the run of the sitcom, but now she takes on a meatier role in Season 9 of The Walking Dead.</p><p>As for Earl, he is played by&nbsp;John Finn, who was seen on the television show Cold Case.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>“The Walking Dead” Season 9 Adds Comic Book Characters Tammy Rose and Earl <a href=#>https://t.co/wWX5eHeZ68</a></p><p>— Bloody Disgusting ? (@BDisgusting) <a href=#>September 5, 2018</a></p><h2>The role of Tammy Rose is going to expand during Season 9</h2><p>Though it took a while for Tammy Rose to appear on the show, the character is going to be around for a while in Season 9. Brett Butler is signed on for a number of episodes, meaning she is going to be around, even after Andrew Lincoln (Rick Grimes) has left the show.</p><p>During the season premiere, Tammy made an appearance as a really headstrong woman, with her husband, Earl, serving more as a supporting character. During the second episode, he was jailed, with Tammy maneuvering her way to visit him and share her disdain for the current leadership structure.</p><p>A lot of foreshadowing is taking place, with Tammy Rose playing an important role on The Walking Dead now.</p><p>The Walking Dead airs Sunday nights at 9/8c on AMC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWivmKR6sbjAsqpmrJGiurp5zqdkraCVYsSiuMqipaBllJqupXnSnpisp55ihnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-otis-chicago-fire.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened to Otis on Chicago Fire?
