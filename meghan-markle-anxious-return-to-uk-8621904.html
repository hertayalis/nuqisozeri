However, sources close to the royals say that while Meghan still hasn't confirmed her attendance, the idea of heading back across the pond is giving her a bit of anxiety.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The dates and details are being kept very hush-hush,” a source told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Express</a>.&nbsp;“Both Harry and Meghan are listed as guests, and a speech has been scheduled, but there is still a question mark over whether Meghan will make an appearance. Her name has been penciled in as a TBC.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The friend went on to say that it's been a while since King Charles and Queen Camilla have had a chance to see their grandkids Archie and Lilibet, so the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games would be a great opportunity for more than just a reunion of the Fab Four.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Charles and Camilla have very good relationships with their other grandchildren, and everyone is keen for them to have a stronger bond with Archie and Lily,” the source added. “Both Harry and Meghan are keen for the children to become closer with Harry’s family, but she’s very anxious about returning to England.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Karwai Tang/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Insiders added that “the children’s attendance is still up in the air because they will only visit the U.K. if their mother, Markle, decides to attend. Prince Harry is hoping that they will join him, so that they can all enjoy the service, and everyone can meet up with members of his family while they are over.”&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Anyone who has taken the time to watch Netflix's&nbsp;Harry & Meghan&nbsp;knows that the Duchess of Sussex had a hard time in England as a full-time senior royal and was even denied care for her mental health when she requested it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I went to one of the most senior people to get help. And I share this because there are so many people who are afraid to voice that they need help, and I know how hard it is to not just voice it but to be told no,” Meghan said in one episode.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meghan also described an instance where she went to the palace’s human resources department and told them directly, “I need help.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“[Human resources] said: ‘My heart goes out to you because I see how bad it is, but there’s nothing we can do to protect you because you’re not a paid employee of the Institution.’ This wasn’t a choice, this was emails and begging for help saying very specifically: ‘I am concerned for my mental welfare,’” Meghan explained. “Nothing was ever done. So, we had to find a solution.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zJ6eoZmeYrqivsqlnGaZnq22sMHSZqmerKWnu27AzmaspGVoa39yhY9t</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chinua-shakur.html><span>←</span><span>Know 2pac Step-brother Chinua Shakur &amp;amp; His Enigmatic Life</span></a>
