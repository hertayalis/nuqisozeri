However, Parton explained that she is, in fact, a feminist, during <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Time</a>magazine's special Time 100 Talks: Finding Hope event. Parton admitted that it was a "tricky" question, since she doesn't like titles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I suppose I am a feminist if I believe that women should be able to do anything they want to," Parton said. "And when I say a feminist, I just mean I don’t have to, for myself, get out and carry signs ... I just really feel I can live my femininity and actually show that you can be a woman and you can still do whatever you want to do."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Parton said that she's not "ashamed" of being labeled a feminist, but knows that she has fans on both sides: some that embrace it and some that turn away.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>NBC/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"But I'm all for all our gals," Parton added. "I think everybody has the right to be who they are."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Back in October, when the podcast premiered, Parton said outright that she didn't think of herself as a feminist, saying, "No, I do not. I think of myself as a woman in business. I love men."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Abumrad explained Parton's strange balancing act during an appearance on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>NPR</a>, saying her statement was "a real surprise" to him.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She is talked about openly as one of the great feminist figures of our time, and so I just figured she thought of herself that way," he said. "But clearly she has a complicated relationship to that term, as do many people who grew up in places in America that aren't the coasts."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeUpLmtxYypmKusn6N6p7HMoqWiq6Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-tablets-holiday-2014.html><span>←</span><span>Windows Tablets - Best Tablets: Holiday 2014</span></a>
