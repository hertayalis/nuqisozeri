In 2013, she told <a href=#>Spry Living</a>, "We all want physically healthy children, but I also want girls who have high self-esteem and good values, morals and ethics. Making sure all of that is intact is probably the hardest thing." Harmon shared her perspective on body image and what lessons she taught her young daughters. She emphasized the importance of focusing on a healthy body rather than dwelling on size. When asked what values are important for her to impart, Harmon replied, "Women need to know that who they are is precious and important, so that they're able to make informed decisions about who's loving them in the way that they need to be loved." At the time, she stressed how she wanted her girls to develop a strong sense of self.</p><p dir=ltr>As Finley and her sisters have gotten older, Harmon has held onto the same values for her kids. In February, Harmon spoke to <a href=#>Charlotte Magazine</a> about raising her teenage daughters. She echoed her previous sentiments about a healthy body image. Yet, since they've entered their teen years, she's had to navigate one curveball. She explained, "Now that they're older, it's TikTok and everyone's in bikinis and twerking. That's been a tough one, letting them know they don't need to get validation from pictures or images you post of yourself out there."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtpaIN2hI6apaChlWK1or7MqKVmnJGqtKnAxKtkn6GeobK6ecarprCmXaq9bq%2FOrqOdZZKaeqmx0WarsKGeZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./was-erik-hooks-arrested-viral-article-explored-as-military-arrests-fema-director.html><span>←</span><span>Was Erik Hooks arrested?
