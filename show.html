While someone with plenty to spend on an elite work center certainly has numerous options, most expensive wooden desks are not inspired or designed by true technology enthusiasts. We do not feel that it does this desk justice to try to evaluate whether or not it is worth the asking price by looking at it piece by piece because plenty of people out there will be perfectly happy with a forty-dollar plastic fold-up table for their desk. Instead, we feel as though this product fills a niche for the consumer who has already decided that they have a certain price range in mind or for the elitist who simply wants either "the best" or at least something totally new and different.<p>A better question then emerges; would the F1 / F2 drive someone who is looking for a very nice desk (but perhaps around the $1,000 price point and not the $3,000 one) to consider spending three times as much for this type of product? This is a tough call. While the Lian Li desk certainly is one of the best of computer desks, it is also the only of its kind. Other manufacturers might see the release of this product as a chance to get into the same business as well, so it's very possible that the F1 / F2 will have competition in the future, and thus lowering the price - but for now, if someone is looking for a desk like this, they really do not have anything to compare it to.</p><p>What we can say about the latest from Lian Li is that it is very well designed, manufactured, and finished, and that it represents something completely unique - definately a product that is at the very top of its class. There just isn't much about the F1 that we reviewed that we didn't like, and the PC V1000 case is also one of the very best ATX cases available on the market today - a perfect combination. If you have the kind of dough to even consider something like this, it comes very highly recommended from us here at AnandTech.</p><p>Once more, there is a sub-article also available that illustrates the whole assembly process in greater detail for those seriously interested in this desk.
