Here are some of the best.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In a startling revelation, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wired</a> recently exposed <a href=#>Mark Zuckerberg</a>'s jaw-dropping scheme to build a massive $100 million <a href=#>Hawaiian compound</a>, boasting an underground bunker, self-sustaining food, and energy sources. The covert nature of this raises eyebrows and fuels speculation that the billionaire might be preparing for a doomsday scenario.</p><p>As the masses ponder whether the <a href=#>Meta founder</a> is privy to some ominous information, a wave of darkly humorous <a href=#>memes</a> has flooded our social media feeds. Brace yourselves for a dose of twisted laughter as we unveil the top eight memes that encapsulate the surreal situation. Check them out below!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What do you think?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>is it a good sign or a bad sign when billionaires are going underground like cats before a storm <a href=#>https://t.co/dwL6yfn0EB</a></p>— Zack Bornstein (@ZackBornstein) <a href=#>December 19, 2023</a></figure><p>While it might be tempting to dismiss this as a billionaire's eccentricity, this could be Zuckerberg's unconventional solution to stave off boredom. With his immense wealth, it's not surprising that he'd work on something this absurd, wouldn't you agree? However, the alternative narrative suggests a more alarming motive — a genuine fear driving him to believe that his underground bunker holds the key to survival in a scary future.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This sounds like something straight out of a film...</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>In 2050 the world will consist of 31 billionaires dotted around the globe in underground bunkers. They will enjoy a prosperous 11 year civilization. One will go to Mars, where he will discover there are even fewer people to make him Kombucha and lattes. There, he will perish. <a href=#>https://t.co/53Cho9a4nW</a></p>— Ed Solomon (@ed_solomon) <a href=#>December 19, 2023</a></figure><p>No lies here — this scenario could make for a gripping movie. Would you tune in? The plot is bizarrely fascinating, although we all know it's just a far-fetched fantasy... or is it?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The real-life Alvar Hanso.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Already been done, Zuck… <a href=#>https://t.co/Yp3WGsbvyg</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FtQD0MHzKF</a></p>— LOST (@TheLOSTFans) <a href=#>December 18, 2023</a></figure><p>OK, is Zuckerberg oblivious to the cautionary tales of shows like <a href=#>Lost</a>? What on earth is going through his mind?!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">We highly doubt Zuckerberg would be smart enough to include a tanning bed.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Please tell me it includes a tanning bed. <a href=#>https://t.co/lTDcCcAwK2</a></p>— Michael Ian Black (@michaelianblack) <a href=#>December 20, 2023</a></figure><p>Within the dim confines of Zuckerberg's compound, inhabitants are destined for a life of misery and a complexion that makes "pale AF" seem like a compliment. Perhaps the <a href=#>Facebook</a> CEO's penchant for the bunker is not just about vanity; it might be a desperate bid to continue evading the sun's rays that he seemingly fears.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The fiction we enjoy has officially been unveiled as nonfiction.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>andy from a murder at the end of the world: <a href=#>https://t.co/nZAZeHNYVp</a></p>— 🥤 (@abdoincolor) <a href=#>December 17, 2023</a></figure><p>The nail-biting finale of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Murder at the End of the World</a> primarily unfolded in the high-tech billionaire Andy Ronson's (Clive Owen) underground bunker — ring a bell? It certainly does! Frankly, the limited series as a whole appears to be a chilling echo of Zuckerberg's endeavors and those of a select cadre of billionaire titans.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Once again, the fiction we love is no longer just fiction — it's real life.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Remember when <a href=#>#MonarchLegacyofMonsters</a> just made this joke. <a href=#>https://t.co/OB9WUe0Wdt</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Khb4MwePN7</a></p>— Omegafreelancer (Commissions OPEN!) (@omegafreelancer) <a href=#>December 18, 2023</a></figure><p>Well, it seems May (Kiersey Clemons) hit the nail on the head in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">"Pink Friday 2" is more important than the end of the world.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Whatever’s going on let it happen after Nicki tour, cause I’ll be pissed <a href=#>https://t.co/oetUM6wZCz</a></p>— ₊⊹ (@ewhure) <a href=#>December 18, 2023</a></figure><p>Listen, the "Queen of Rap" has been absent from the touring scene for almost half a decade. So, if the apocalypse is imminent, can it at least wait until after <a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a>'s highly anticipated "Pink Friday 2 World Tour"? Our tickets are in hand, and nothing, not even Zuckerberg's underground compound, will keep us from witnessing the spectacle.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">We would pass on staying in Zuckerberg's underground compound.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Me looking for the roommate wanted ad on craigslist. <a href=#>https://t.co/RihwWs2VyR</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8CZf70dGmv</a></p>— Don Cozy. (@DontMindGrimey) <a href=#>December 17, 2023</a></figure><p>Opting to reserve a spot in Zuckerberg's underground compound? That's a resounding no from anyone in their right mind. Who in the world would willingly sign up for that chilling adventure? Not us, that's for sure!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6zt4yzrJyjlaevpr7GZp%2Bar5Getm6vzqanqK2emXquscyeqg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emilia-clarke-lot-crap-nudity-game-thrones.html><span>←</span><span>Emilia Clarke Still Gets A Lot Of Crap For Her Nudity In Game Of Thrones</span></a>
