Park‚Äîwho was also already a professional actor with some key credits to their name‚Äîmade clear that, although their tweet to Gaiman got the ball rolling, they actually landed the role through the usual channels.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>After Neil and I interacted here my agents set up an audition through Lucinda.

Still, given how spot-on the casting has been on the series so far, we‚Äôve no doubt Gaiman and his team will find the perfect person to portray Delirium in season 2.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yvscilZKCZmaKur3nHmqpmmpGZeq%2Bx1qxkn6eiYq6vxc6nnGagn6W2r7OMraZmop%2Beu27Ax55krJmembqiuoysnJqrn6N6c3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meadow-walker-age-how-old-is-she-find-out.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Meadow Walker Age: How Old Is She?
