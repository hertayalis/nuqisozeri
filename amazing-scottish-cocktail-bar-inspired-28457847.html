We traveled just for this cocktail experience to see there and back again, and wasn’t disappointed, the whole design of the bar is great if you are a LOTR fan!"</p><p>A third wrote: "Went for the there and back again theme. The cocktails were fantastic, loved that some needed a riddle to be solved to get them and absolutely loved the decorations.
