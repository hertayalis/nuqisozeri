There are already some hints that this may be the case with the trailer alone giving fans plenty to chew on. For example, the car Winston drives has some pretty interesting implications.</p><h2 id=h-what-type-of-car-is-winston-driving-on-the-show data-injectable=false>What type of car is Winston driving on the show?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mel-gibson-the-continental.jpg><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>Obviously being set in the seventies it makes sense that Winston would drive one of the most popular cars from that era: the 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1 to be precise. It’s a legendary muscle car and is still widely revered as a classic even today. Seeing Winston drive around in such an iconic car whilst surrounded by period-accurate haircuts and clothing is peak seventies.</p><h2 id=h-there-s-more-significance-to-the-car data-injectable=false>There’s more significance to the car</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/the-continental-featured-image-1.jpg><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>Of course, the car does more than just being another prop for this groovy seventies backdrop; it has much more importance than that. Fans of the films will already be more than aware that the Ford Mustang is John Wick’s car of choice. The car has kind of become famous all over again thanks to the Baba Yaga.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=755 data-injectable=true>But it goes deeper than that, the silver-gray color and the black rally stripes on Wick’s car match Winston’s car in every way, it’s not just the same make and model, this is the same car. The one that gets stolen in the first film and trashed in the second. In fact, they even have the same number plate proving that Winston is driving John’s car, or I guess John is driving Winston’s car seeing as it was technically his first.</p><h2 id=h-what-does-this-mean data-injectable=false>What does this mean?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/The-Continental.jpg><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>For a while fans have been speculating that there is some kind of familial relationship between Winston and Wick, they seem to be more than just work colleagues and some have even theorized that he’s John’s father. The likelihood of that may be low but the fact that we now know that Winston gave John his car really hints at there being more of a connection between the two.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=false>Another theory suggests that John’s wife Helen is Winston’s daughter, thus making John his son-in-law. This could be more likely as we’ve never seen anything to suggest that Winston and John are blood-related, but they could be related through Helen. Once again there isn’t anything confirming that yet but the car being passed from Winston to John will certainly fan the flames of these theories.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZK2xoJp6sLKMnJirZZSksrR51qKlrKyfo3qlvsivnGahnmLBqbGMnKanrJmjsq%2FAwKVm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./509194-tyler-the-creator-interviews-vince-staples-new-video.html><span>←</span><span>Tyler, The Creator Interviews Vince Staples</span></a>
