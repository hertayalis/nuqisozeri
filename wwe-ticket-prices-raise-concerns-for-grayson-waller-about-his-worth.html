Interestingly enough, Waller took issue with the fact that WWE ticket prices are undervaluing his presence during WWE live events.</p><p>The Australian star established himself as one of the must-see stars during his time in NXT. The Australian&nbsp;is now a mainstay of Friday Night SmackDown and loves putting his money where his mouth is.</p><p>For the past few months, Grayson Waller has been partnering with Austin Theory on the blue brand and feuding with the likes of Kevin Owens – something that fans are definitely enjoying.</p><p>While speaking to&nbsp;<a href=#>CW39 Houston</a>&nbsp;to promote an upcoming WWE live event, Grayson&nbsp;Waller about about WWE live event tickets being priced at only $20, making it clear takes issue with the fact that tickets to see him are so cheap.</p><p>”I’m a little upset to be honest, I was looking and it’s 20 dollars to get a ticket. 20 dollars to see Grayson Waller. I’m a little bit offended. I feel that’s not much money. I think the prices need to go up. 20 dollars to see Grayson Waller, that’s a bit of a steal. I’m gonna have to make a call to Santa.”</p><p>Grayson Waller also wants to <a href=#>test himself against CM Punk in promo battle</a> somewhere down the line. WWE has major plans for Grayson Waller as he and Austin Theory continue to be a highlight on WWE television. We will have to wait and see how the company will book them in the coming weeks.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your view on what Grayson Waller had to say?
