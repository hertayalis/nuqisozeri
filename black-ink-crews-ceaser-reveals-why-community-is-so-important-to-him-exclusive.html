They give you space, time, and the ability to grow your talents and business, so why not give back when opportunities present themselves? "You know we have the social injustice and all, and basically awareness for the [COVID-19] vaccine, like we're doing a lot of things for our community," <a href=#>Emanuel told us of the new episodes of "Black&nbsp;Ink&nbsp;Crew."</a>&nbsp;</p><p>"What a lot of people have to understand is "Black Ink" is basically based in the community,"&nbsp;Emanuel added.&nbsp;"Most of the shops are based in Black, mostly what people would call 'the hood' communities." Explaining why giving back to this specific community is so important to him, he continued, "It's something that I strive to do because I could have sat there and put my shops in like malls or high-end places. But to me, I like showing my people and showing people that I grew up with and grew up like me, that there's opportunities besides just the regular normal playing basketball or being a rapper or just being something of [an] entertainment stature."</p><p>Emanuel is proud that he's stuck to his roots. "...Like think about 10 years [later]. I'm still with my community," he said. In fact, he likely wishes more celebrities remembered where they came from. "There's not too many celebrities 10 years strong on television, still saying, going back to that community, feeding their community, doing stuff with their community, talking to the community, talking to the people in school." Just another reason to respect Ceaser Emanuel so much.</p><p>"Black Ink Crew: New York" airs Mondays on VH1 at 8 pm ET/7 pm C.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcHFgaX54e8GlmJyjXZ67rHnCq5ywq12YsqK%2FxKtkq52mmq6tv4ywn7Jlk6S6rsHNoquyZZmoerS7jKKkqaeiqa6vwIytpmagmaJ6psTCpaysoaaafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sixteen-jones-net-worth-185218.html><span>←</span><span>Sixteen Jones Net Worth</span></a>
