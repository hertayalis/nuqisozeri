Now, the second step in any good concert prep is finding the perfect outfit to wear.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Thankfully, because this is <a href=#>The Eras Tour</a>, there are plenty of different looks to choose from, inspired by Taylor's album aesthetics, song lyrics, or even Taylor herself!</p><p>So, if you're feeling creatively stumped and need Taylor Swift <a href=#>concert outfit</a> ideas, we have you covered. Check out these neat ideas from across the 'net.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Check out these Taylor Swift concert outfit suggestions for the Eras Tour.</h2><p>Naturally, with the difficulty surrounding getting tickets to the tour and the <a href=#>injustice of Ticketmaster,</a> many fans have been talking amongst themselves on social media platforms, especially Twitter and TikTok, about outfit ideas. If you're feeling stuck creatively or don't know where to start thinking about concert outfit ideas, there's plenty of inspiration from which to choose! Here are a few examples from Swifties.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Some outfits are purely aesthetic-based.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Even if you're not drawing direct inspiration from any single one of Taylor's various looks, you can always go where the fashion muse brings you! User @madisonvdt suggests you dress — inspired directly by "Midnights" — in slouchy sweaters and sparkly skirts. Or, try leather-and-lace for a look that is both suited to a midnight rendezvous and a concert!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">You can emulate Taylor's previous concert looks.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Taylor is known for putting on show-stopping performances during her tours, but her tour costumes are also pretty iconic. You can attempt to re-create any one of her costumes, especially those from the "Fearless" and "Speak Now" tours, which had fairytale influences.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>You could also re-create looks from Taylor's "RED" tour, which incorporated both a marching band and high-waisted shorts, or even the "1989" tour, which had shimmering tops and two-piece sets. Feeling edgy? Replicate a look from the "Reputation" tour with a black sparkly jumpsuit.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Wear and outfit inspired by Taylor's album covers.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Taylor has many iconic album covers, so if you're short on ideas, you can always try to mimic her looks there! The majority of Taylor Swift's album covers feature her in a colored dress and curly hair, so don't forget to get your hands on a nice sparkly dress ("Speak Now," "Fearless," and "Taylor Swift") or a colored shirt with some accessories ("RED," "1989," "Reputation," and "Lover").</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Or you can don an outfit inspired by specific song lyrics.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Yes, we're going to talk about the "mirrorball dress"! When Taylor Swift wore a reflective Balmain gown to the American Music Awards in 2018, fans immediately began to refer to it as the "mirrorball dress" following the release of her album "Folklore" for a song called "Mirrorball."</p><p>This is one of many examples of how fans have dressed as Taylor's lyrics, sometimes literally, like TikTok user @fearlessfallon!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Or you can dress like one of Taylor's muses.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>For all of the flack Taylor gets for writing songs about her exes, how fun would it be to dress up as one of them attending her show? Maybe you're Jake Gyllenhaal with Taylor's old scarf or Joe Jonas with his early 2000s-boy-band-era haircut. Even Frankie Jonas, Joe's brother, took this route for Halloween when he and his girlfriend dressed up like Joe and Taylor.</p><p>Speaking of Taylor's muses, some fans have even taken to dressing like Jack Antonoff, such as TikTok user @luispabloromo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqa66uM6rZKyvmZvBbq%2FOp5qeqqRivLbAxaKrZqGUmq60</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-pare-net-worth-83161.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Par Net Worth</span></a>
