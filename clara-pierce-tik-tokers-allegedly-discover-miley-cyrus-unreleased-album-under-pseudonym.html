However, TikTok users are also convinced that she secretly released even more music in 2023 on the same day as her last album release under a pseudonym.</p><p>Fans on social media believe that another Cyrus album was leaked under the name 'Clara Pierce'. The album is called 'Down with Me' and the vocals sound similar to Cyrus'.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Miley Cyrus snapped together with her mom for first time after Tish Cyrus' engagement to Dominic Purcell</a></p><p><a href=# rel>False alarm: Liam Hemsworth NOT suing Miley Cyrus for defamation over 'Flowers' as documents leaked online are forged</a></p><h2 class=split>Who is Clara Pierce?</h2><p>The album 'Down with Me', issued under the guise of "Clara Pierce", has vocals that sound uncannily similar to those of the former 'Hannah Montana' actress, Miley Cyrus. Unfortunately, the mysterious artist, Clara Pierce, and the album 'Down with Me', have now been removed from Spotify and other platforms but it was possible to listen to the album earlier. The cover art of the album features the title in an old-school Pinterest font against a mountain landscape. However, the Spotify profile picture doesn't look like Miley Cyrus at all.</p><h2 class=split>What are the songs and how are they related to Miley?</h2><p>The 12-track LP — featuring tunes such as 'I Don’t Wanna Tell You Lies', 'Hands of Time', 'Can’t Live Forever', 'Not My Vibe', and 'Right Hand Man' — is rumored to comprise leaked, previously unreleased material from Cyrus.</p><p>One song is titled 'Sagittarius', most likely after the singer's zodiac sign and a number of songs on the album appear to draw obvious parallels to her career.</p><p>The artist refers to a 'SHE IS COMING' single, saying, "I told you once before, I’m my Mother’s Daughter.”</p><p>'SHE IS COMING' was supposed to be followed by 'SHE IS MILEY CYRUS', an album that was never released. “Just when I thought the body of work was finished… it was all erased. Including most of the music’s relevance. Because everything had changed,” she said in an Instagram post before releasing Plastic Hearts, referring to the loss of the material in a 2018 house fire. “Nature did what I now see as a favor and destroyed what I couldn’t let go of for myself. I lost my house in a fire but found myself in its ashes.”</p><h2 class=split>'What if it’s Hannah Montana'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/c09a5d78-8d0c-4acc-ae6b-0a5c6b3810e5.jpg><p>TikTok sleuths uncovered that many of the songs in Clara Pierce's album are identical to those almost featured on Cyrus' scrapped album, 'SHE IS MILEY CYRUS'. “What if it’s Hannah Montana,” A TikTok user wrote. "First Hannah Montana… now Clara Pierce? She knows what she’s doing haha genius, another commented." "It is her because in Sagittarius it sounds like she is saying what’s good now what’s good now Miley wants good", reads a comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRom5yWv6J5z6Kcq5uVYsGqt4ytpqSdoqh6orjLnp6enJyueqW10pymr52iYrqquMSyZJyxoqrAbsHNq5ylnZGosqV5wKWZrqVdqrulsdFmp6ydpZm8r8XM</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-upcoming-will-smith-movies-releasing-in-2022-and-beyond.html><span>←</span><span>All upcoming Will Smith movies releasing in 2022 and beyond</span></a>
