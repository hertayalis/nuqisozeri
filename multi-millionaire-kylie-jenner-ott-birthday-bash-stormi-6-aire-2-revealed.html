On the dance floor beneath the dancer, the word 'STORMI' was emblazoned in big colorful letters. The DJ booth was decorated with clouds, as a false night sky was behind them, and kids could be heard screaming with excitement in the background.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d6e58c3a7853-screenshot20240206084202instagram.jpg><p id=eI4TIPINEf data-wc=38>Another incredible detail from the party was that Kylie had hired out fairground rides.
