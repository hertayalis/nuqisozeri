The owners Nicole and Lars Ellingson surrendered their 10-year-old English Setter, Watson, to a local animal shelter after the dog bit their two-year-old son who was sleeping.</p><p>Nicole and Lars claimed the Denver Animal Shelter (DAS) agreed to them to keep Watson for 10 days at the shelter and would release him when a home suitable for him is found but they were told there was a "risk he could be euthanized," according to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Mirror</a>.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Is Honey Boo Boo pregnant?

The couple claimed DAS's "story has changed and are now left devastated that they have given Watson a "death sentence" under "false pretenses."</p><p>Talking to Fox 31, Lars described the issue as a "big understanding" as there is a "good home for Watson, it’s a home without children and there is no reason he should not be allowed to enjoy that," and added, "But I think their mind is made up. We hope that they can reconsider." Many people have gathered outside the shelter to protest. Holding placards and signs, protestors chanted, "Free Watson… save his life… do what is right."</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Why did Honey Boo Boo ditch Anna Cardwell's 'last' trip?

Denver Animal Protection is charged with protecting both the safety of people and animals in our community," added the statement.</p><p>According to a city spokesperson, the couple signed an official document that granted DAS "full legal custody" of Watson. "I release full legal custody of the animal described above with the request that this animal be humanely euthanized by DAP," stated the document.</p><p>"Because of the severity of this bite and the history that his owner disclosed to us upon surrender – he has bitten the same child in the face before – we are closely reviewing whether it is safe to release him back into the community. We take this decision very seriously and will act in the best interest of our community," read the statement.</p><p>The dog's quarantine ended on July 23. However, no final decision has been made in the case as the city spokesperson said the matter is being reviewed. The&nbsp;Southwest English Setter rescue - with whom the couple wants Watson to be shifted has been campaigning to release Watson.</p><p>"URGENT - Possibly only HOURS to live - SAVE Watson's life! Call and email Denver Animal Shelter Director Melanie Sobel immediately! Watson should not be killed!" read the rescue shelter's statement.</p><p>"Numerous English Setter experts have all been communicating to her since Thursday that this was not an aggressive incident. Not a SINGLE ES breed expert has agreed with the shelter's aggressive assessment, including DVMs. Watson does NOT have a history of aggression," the statement added.</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>How did Harald Hasselbach die?
