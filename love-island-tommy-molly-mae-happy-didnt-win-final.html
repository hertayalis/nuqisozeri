"We're really happy for Amber and Greg at the end of the day, they've been in there a short amount of time together but they're incredible together," Molly-Mae said. "Greg's an amazing guy and treats Amber like gold and Amber's an incredible girl and she had a really hard time in the villa – so you know what, we're both really happy for them. We think everyone is."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bec8487a6b20-love-island-amber-greg-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eiIHlsc85Et data-wc=9><strong>Amber and Greg won after just 12 days together</strong></p><p id=exwIgBOP-X3 data-wc=1><strong>MORE:<a class=hm-link href=#> Love Island's Ovie teases future film career&nbsp;</a></strong></p><p id=eI7Ce6e_0q5r data-wc=77>Touching on the subject further when asked about their shorter romance, Molly-Mae added: "There's no annoyance at all. Time is nothing, you can be with someone a few days and it feels like you've known them forever. It doesn't matter about time – yeah Tommy and I have been in there from the start but it doesn't matter, Amber and Greg won, they deserved it, they're incredible together and there's absolutely no bitterness or anything at all."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/239c8a105149-love-tommy-molly-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=etwBOmsGi3RO data-wc=5><strong>Tommy and Molly-Mae came runners-up</strong></p><p id=e-sKmAnVLsJa data-wc=1><strong>READ:<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Love Island winner Amber reacts to Michael being back with Joanna</a></strong></p><p id=eyCnLPedohXO data-wc=110>The 20-year-old also responded to persistent claims from viewers that she was being "fake" in the villa. She explained: "It's hard to comment as I've been myself. As for being fake, Tommy knows how I feel about him, I know how I feel about Tommy. At the end of the day, we made it to the final and had I been fake we definitely wouldn't have made it that far. The people that really matter to me know how I feel about Tommy and that's all that matters. At the end of the day, we weren’t in there to win. We came second. It's incredible. It's not a big deal."</p><p id=e_5pzVms-hCd data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
