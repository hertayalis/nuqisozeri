With his recent success in India and China markets combined he has got the title of Worlds Biggest Superstar. He went through rapid transformations in his body structure for his films to bring out the reality factor in his characters. This is also one of the reasons why his films and he is loved all over the world. His most visible changes include the movies like Ghajini, 3 idiots, Talaash, Dhoom 3, PK and Dangal. With his recent successful movies like Dangal, Pk , Talaash and TV serial Satyamev jayate, his image has become more of a serious actor. However, the truth is that he is a fabulous actor when it comes to comedy too. He has played some really funny iconic characters in some cult comedy movies like Andaaz Apna Apna, Ishq, Mela, Dil chahta hai and many more. He has also done a lot of TVC where his character was funny like Coca cola, Tata sky and Snapdeal.</p><p>Aamir khan is said to open Chinese market for Indian Films. Lagaan in 2001 released in china nationwide. 3 idiots became a cult hit in china. After 3 idiots becoming a big hit, his other movies like Taare zameen par and Ghajini also went on to gain huge fan following. Aamir Khan's next big movies like Dhoom 3 (2013), PK (2014) and Dangal (2016) also became successful on chinese box office. His recent movie Secret superstar (2017) became a huge hit too in China.</p><p>Aamir was first introduced as a child artiste in the 1970's hit Yaadon Ki Baaraat (1973) - he was the youngest child in the trio.</p><p>His performance in Earth (1998) as the Ice-Candy man has received rave reviews from Indian and international critics. Using classic "method acting" and an adopted technique inspired by his seniors Sanjeev Kumar, Rajesh Khanna, <a href=#>Dev Anand</a> and Shammi Kapoor, Aamir acts in all genres of Indian films - comedy, action, drama and romance. He is regarded as a complete Indian actor of the post 1990 generation of actors for his diverse choice of roles and films. In 2007 he turned director with the film Taare Zameen Par (2007), which not only brought him immense critical acclaim but was also a huge box office success. Many of his films are considered as cult classics like Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India (2001), Dil Chahta Hai (2001), Rang De Basanti (2006), Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar (1992) and Andaz Apna Apna (1994). He divorced his first wife in December 2001 and married Kiran Rao in December 2005.</p><p>In 2008 his first all out commercial action film Ghajini (2008) went on to become the highest grossing film of its time in Indian Cinema and 4th highest inflation adjusted, grossing a total of Rs.226 on the worldwide box office and the first film to cross 100 crores on the domestic Indian box office, making a total of Rs.115 crores. This record didn't last long, though, since his next release 3 Idiots (2009) went on to shatter not only the highest grosser record but many more. It not only made the highest opening first day, first weekend and first week records but subsequently continued to shatter many records on the following weekends and weeks, making many circuits on the way. It made a total of Rs.202 crores domestically and Rs.400 crores on the worldwide box office, becoming the highest overseas grosser to date, a staggering feat given that no other film had even come close to making Rs.100 crores on the domestic box office until then, except for his own Ghajini (2008) the previous year.</p><p>Aamir is said to be the actor who first started the trend of actors working in one film at a time, when the others worked in four or five at the same time. He is also known to shun popular film trade magazine awards like Filmfare, Star Screen, etc. as he doesn't have trust in their credibility and transparency. Recently he was awarded the third highest civilian honor Padama Bhushan by the government of India.</p><p>Aamir Khan's range of characterizations remains unparalleled and because of this diversity, and his ability to portray different characters believably on screen, today he is regarded as not only one of the biggest Superstars but also one of the finest actors of Indian Cinema.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeRlrqqvoykn5qmXaOytXnWqKmtoF1nfnKBkGw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./xavier-roberts-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Xavier Roberts Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
