Jessica Alba treated her daughters to some street vendor eats near her Honest Company office, while Mariah Carey sipped some bubbly (we think, since she's a diva at all times!) on Easter Sunday.

Mmm, delish!</p><p><h3>Check out Mindy Kaling's sandwich!</h3></p><p><h3>Jessica Alba's plates look almost too good mess up by, you know, eating what's assembled on them. She's also a notorious food pic poster.</h3></p><h3>That munchaholic known as&nbsp;<a href=#>Snoop Dogg</a>'s breakfast consisted of fruit.</h3><p><h3>Street food caught Mindy Kaling's eye.</h3></p><h3><a href=#>Jessie J</a>'s healthy, fish-centric meal. It's mackerel and the British singer fueled up.</h3><p><h3>Miss Jessie J also posted a snap of her delicious, leafy green salad, consumed during a break in the studio. Her food pic posts are the best. We know, we see them every day! She is a healthy eater. This pic is so rich and green that it makes us want to head to the nearest SaladWorks.</h3></p><p><h3>J. Alba and her daughters enjoyed lunch truck eats by mom's Honest Company offices. Honor and Haven are ADORBS!</h3></p><p><h3>That was some beefy burger for Kevin McHale to consume on Easter Sunday. That thing is bigger than our heads.</h3></p><p><h3>Mimi sipped (what looks like) some champagne on Easter Sunday. A diva's got to have her fave beverage. We don't really envision her sipping apple juice.</h3></p><p><h3>Buffet-style is also good, as Kevin McHale demonstrated.</h3></p><h3><a href=#>Gavin DeGraw</a> noshed on Easter donuts. Sunday is a good cheat day, even on Easter, where you should be allowed to eat all the junk you want.</h3><h3>Mega pregnant&nbsp;<a href=#>Ciara</a> indulged her cravings and had some butter pecan ice cream. The singer is eating for two, so let her have at it!</h3><p><h3>Emmy Rossum is allergic to gluten, but that didn't stop her from bagel sniffing and indulging without eating. She had to indulge her senses somehow, right?</h3></p><p><h3>Another Jessie J food snap. She enjoyed some healthy AM eats. Coconut water is faboosh!</h3></p><h3><a href=#>Lance Bass</a> raised a glass of mead at Medieval Times. It's like 'Cable Guy' all over again. Who doesn't love food-as-entertainment?</h3><h3>That's an apple that <a href=#>Hilary Duff</a> was in the middle of, while watching 'Blacklist.'</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6Wws8HSoWWcp51ksKa4xJuqZp2Rqbavs4yjnKyrmZiubq3Lm5hmpZGntqK0jJyYq52pYrOwu8Nmp6GnpKTAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emory-williams-parents.html><span>←</span><span>Meet His Father Stephen Williams And Mother Melissa Williams</span></a>
