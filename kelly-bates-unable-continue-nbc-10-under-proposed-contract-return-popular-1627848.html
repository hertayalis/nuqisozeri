I loved my job at NBC 10 and it makes me profoundly sad to leave it after 17 years."</p><p>Fletcher Fischer—the business manager for IBEW Local 1228, the union that represents workers at NBC 10—said, per The Boston Globe: "I know people are leaving left and right," adding that the deal offered to Bates was "insulting."</p><p>"People at the station love to work there," continued Fischer, whose union represents on-air and off-air workers. "But at some point, people have to be able to pay their bills. And [Bates] wanted to be treated fairly."</p><p>Elaborating further, Fischer stated that Bates' hours had been cut back to part-time 10 years ago, with her having the option to take on other people's hours when they took time off. According to Fischer, those opportunities recently petered out, reportedly leaving Bate in a position of financial strain.</p><figure class=fullCode></figure><p>The Boston Globe reported that the latest contract offer proved unattractive in the end for Bates, as it included the continuation of reduced hours with fewer opportunities for overtime and a "modest" pay rise.</p><p>WJAR general manager Vic Vetters had previously told Go Local that Bates was no longer in the station's employment because she'd turned down a new contract.</p><p>"The WJAR team is saddened that meteorologist Kelly Bates is leaving the station after nearly 17 great years together," Vetters said in a statement. "Kelly ultimately decided it was time to move on and elected not to renew her contract with us.</p><p>"We thank Kelly for her dedication to WJAR and her commitment to keeping our viewers informed with critical weather updates throughout the years. We wish her nothing but the best in her future endeavors."</p><figure class=fullCode><p lang=en dir=ltr>So friends. This is it.
