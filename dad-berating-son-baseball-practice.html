It's not cute, and as a matter of fact, these <a href=#>nasty remarks</a> directly influence how much a child enjoys — or, in this case, hates — the sporting experience.</p><p>On Sept. 26, 2023, <a href=#>TikTok</a> creator 3A (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@emba333</a>) posted a video she took of a man berating his young son during a baseball hitting session. He didn't have a single nice word to say about his kid, and eventually, the TikTok user got so fed up that she confronted the guy. Read on to find out what happened next.</p><p>Plus, stick around to hear what the internet has to say.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Stock photo</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This woman caught a father berating his young son at batting practice.</h2><p>In the now-viral video, which was captured at Murdy Park in Huntington Beach, Calif., the dad was throwing pitches to his son — but every time his little boy hit the ball, it wasn't good enough. He told his son they should just "give all his c--- away" before yelling at the boy for doing everything wrong.</p><p>"You don't know your lunges, you don't do your exercises," the man screamed before telling his son that if he doesn't hit, he's off the team. "I've told you too many times that this is what you need to do, [but] you don't do any of it."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@emba333 href=#>@emba333</a><p>September 26 @ 3:40p we listened in disbelief long before we even pressed record. this dad had not a single kind word for his baby who was doing his best. genuinely who does this guy think he is, not god at pitching thats for one tf</p><a title="♬ original sound - 3A" href=#>♬ original sound - 3A</a></figure><p>"If you want to know the truth, I'm p----d," he carried on before throwing a terrible pitch. "There's no f------ excuse for that; you should hit everything your way. You've seen a 100,000 pitches in your life, but you're missing balls down the middle." We bet he has, but they're probably a lot better than whatever his dad was throwing.</p><p>Not long after, the boy's father told his son to quickly pick up all the baseballs because he wanted them to "get the f--- out" of the park as fast as humanly possible. The man continued criticizing his son, shouting, "Again, for the 12th f------ time this summer, we'll end early because you can't hit ... [and] you don't do any of the work."</p><p>In a follow-up video shared that same day, the TikTok creator revealed that she actually confronted the boy's dad for his unacceptable and erratic behavior.</p><p>"Hey buddy, you're doing really good, OK? You're doing really good," the TikToker told the little boy before directing her attention to his father. "Sir, shouldn't we be a little quieter about that? The things you are saying, don't you think it's a little harsh to [say] to your kid?"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@emba333 href=#>@emba333</a><p>i have no regrets confronting this dad for his treatment of his child, sports is a competitive field i get that but is no way an excuse for this kind of verbal n mental abuse. i hope this babys every thought is validated that this is not normal. i will never be a bystander <a title=huntingtonbeach href=#>#huntingtonbeach</a> <a title=oceanviewlittleleauge href=#>#oceanviewlittleleauge</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - 3A" href=#>♬ original sound - 3A</a></figure><p>"He's doing really well; those are just not good throws," the TikTok creator added. "He's a really little kid, he's batting really well, [but] those are just not good throws." We couldn't agree more!</p><p>The boy's dad said he appreciated the concern, but told the TikToker he doesn't want to raise a "marshmallow" — OK, cool, but that doesn't mean he had to degrade his son in a public setting to get his point across.</p><p>"The only compliment you have said to your son is that he has a good eye to your bad throws, do you realize that?" the TikTok creator stated, and it's safe to say this enraged the boy's dad. He told the creator he wasn't listening to her, but she clapped back, "You should be because you're screaming at your child. Your kid shouldn't be listening to you."</p><p>"He doesn't deserve to be yelled at by his father," she added before the video ended.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok / @_mandys_._</span></figure><p>The second video received over 4,100 comments from fellow social media users praising the creator for speaking up and confronting the boy's father. We don't know about you, but we hope the TikTok creator's word got through to the dad because he has a lot of change to make regarding his parenting style.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma6lecGeqZqsmaO0br%2FOp2SbmaOar6K4y2anq5mTqbaksQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-exercise-burns-most-calories.html><span>←</span><span>What exercise burns most calories?</span></a>
