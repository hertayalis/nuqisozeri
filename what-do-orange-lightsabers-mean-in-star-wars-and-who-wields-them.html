A Jedi in possession of one has not completely turned their back on either belief system but rather exists somewhere in the middle.</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>Becoming a symbol of knowledge, wisdom, and power, orange lightsabers ⏤ which are incredibly rare ⏤ signify a break from traditional values and a transition into a much more radical belief system. The most recent orange lightsaber wielder in Star Wars canon is none other than Rey Skywalker, as seen in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Why are Gray Jedis important?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">orange-yellow blade in the movie</a> is a reminder that the Force is ever-changing. To be able to have balance, a Gray Jedi must use both the light and the dark, not one or the other. That requires the Jedi to step away from the Jedi way and also forsake the path of the Sith. This tends to indicate that those who use orange lightsabers are contemplative loners who create an entirely unique path.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=49 data-current-count=49 data-injectable=false>Here’s a look at the unofficial Gray Jedi code:</p><p>“There must be both dark and light. I will do what I must to keep the balance, as the balance is what holds all life. There is no good without evil, but evil must not be allowed to flourish. There is passion, yet peace; serenity, yet emotion; chaos, yet order. I am a wielder of the flame; a champion of balance. I am a guardian of life. I am a Gray Jedi.”</p><p data-characters=502 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=false>Coming from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Legends</a>, Gray Jedi has never explicitly been mentioned in any canonical material that Lucasfilm has released over the last 44 years. That hasn’t stopped this particular section of Force users from becoming fan favorites, though, and many are clamoring for Star Wars to officially introduce the term in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">main canon</a>. Until then, all we can do is appreciate the beauty and power of orange lightsabers, recognizing that they mean so much more than just a simple color option.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZJ2nXaS%2ForrGnmSloZedwbStwZ6prGWdmq6vecinZKyskad6uK3RrGSappRixKm7jLCgnqSUqHq1tMSmZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./radish-greens.html><span>←</span><span>How to Use Radish Greens</span></a>
