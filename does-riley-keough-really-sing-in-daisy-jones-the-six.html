The story is told through the oral history format with accounts from members of the band, their families, and friends. It includes flashbacks, drama, and, of course, drugs, sex, and rock n’ roll.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Based on the Taylor Jenkins Reid novel of the same name, Daisy Jones & The Six took a total of three and a half years to complete, from the moment of its conception to its official release date. The delay was due in large part to the COVID-19 pandemic but thankfully, it gave its cast plenty of time to get comfortable on stage.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true>Included in the show are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">10 original songs</a> as part of the fictional album Aurora, for which Reid wrote the lyric herself in the novel. Ahead of the show’s premiere, the album even shot to number one on the US iTunes charts. In addition to being available to stream, fans can also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">purchase the vinyl version</a>.</p><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=207 data-injectable=false>The real question though is whether or not Riley Keough — and the rest of the cast —&nbsp; sang her own songs, or if someone else was brought on to do the reference vocals and the actual songs themselves</p><h2 id=h-is-that-really-riley-keough-s-voice-on-the-mic-or-someone-else data-injectable=false>Is that really Riley Keough’s voice on the mic, or someone else?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>Musicality really does run in the family. That songbird refrain you hear coming out of Daisy Jones’ voice is, in fact, Riley Keough’s. The 33-year-old actress spent over a year strengthening her vocal cords to keep up with the rigor of recording an entire album. As a matter of fact, there is zero dubbing on the show whatsoever.</p><p data-characters=572 data-current-count=909 data-injectable=true>Initially, Keough found the prospect of singing publicly daunting. Executive producer Lauren Neustadter told <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a> that Keough’s lineage was taken into consideration prior to casting, and she was asked whether or not she could feasibly (and convincingly) sing live. “We talked about her singing and we talked about her grandfather,” said Neustadter. “And she sort of said, ‘You know, I know I have it in me, but I really don’t sing outside the shower. This is not a thing that I’ve done before, but I’m ready to do the work’, and she really did.”</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>When told she would have to learn how to belt, Keough said, “I was like, what does that even mean? I didn’t even know how one gets to be able to sing loud. I went to a vocal coach and I was like, they need me to belt.”</p><p data-characters=150 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>Keough leaned on Lady Gaga for inspiration, practicing the hit song “Shallow” from A Star is Born, which does indeed include a massive belt.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=820 data-injectable=true>“I was like, are you out of your mind, it’s not an easy song to sing. I sounded so bad that I started crying. I was like, I can’t do it, and when I can’t do something it lights a fire in me to be able to do it. I was like, I have to do it. I’m gonna go to this vocal coach, and he’s gonna teach me how to f****ing belt, whatever I need to do to get this. It really became about pushing myself to do things I’ve never done before.”</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=236 data-injectable=false>It all paid off. Sam Claflin, who plays Billy Dunne in the show — Daisy’s bandmate, co-lead singer, and star-crossed lover — said, “Seeing her come alive in that role is just, I mean, it’s mesmerizing, it’s magical.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>In the novel, Daisy Jones is described as having an innately captivating singing voice that mesmerizes anyone who hears it. She’s fierce, passionate, and unapologetic, and that all comes out when she sings. That’s not an easy trait to capture, but seeing as Keough’s performance is what <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reviews can’t stop raving about</a>, she evidently succeeded.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=62 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=false>Daisy Jones & The Six premieres on Prime Video on March 3.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ylu8SsZKuhnJrGbrfEqKygoF2nsqK4y7JkrKGenHqquoydmKKrqWK3sLrErGStoJViwKrEjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./julia-foxs-look-at-film-independent-spirits-awards.html><span>←</span><span>'Raccoon eyes': Julia Fox trolled for edgy dress and heavy eye makeup at Spirit Awards</span></a>
