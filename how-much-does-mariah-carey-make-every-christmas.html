However, fans were skeptical of whether that figure was accurate.</p><p>A 2014 article in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a> claimed that "over the course of 19 years — from 1994 to 2013 — the song made [Mariah] a total of $50 million in royalties. When we calculate that out on an annual basis, it's $3.8 million per year."</p><p>It's possible those figures, while unspecified, were global, and definitely out-measured the Daily Mail's figures.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>As it turns out, per a 2017 report in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Economist</a>, "All I Want for Christmas Is You" in the U.S. alone provided Mariah with $60 million between 1994 and 2016, meaning it nets her an average of approximately $2.6 million per year.</p><p>That's not even counting the U.K. royalties, the streaming plays, and more. In 2020, Mariah went the extra mile by also airing a Christmas special on Apple TV Plus known as <a href=#>Mariah Carey's Magical Christmas Special</a>. The exact monetary figure that special netted her was never disclosed.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Mariah Carey's net worth?</h2><p>For however impressive Mariah's income is around Christmastime alone, the amount that she has brought in throughout her career as a whole is staggering. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Mariah is worth around $320 million, an impressive sum that is attributed to not only her music but her work as an entrepreneur and an actress as well.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Mariah Carey</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Singer and songwriter</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $320 million</p><p>Mariah Carey is a singer, songwriter and actress who has sold over 220 million records worldwide.
