But perhaps the one character Marvel Studios needs to nail most of all is Doctor Doom. With no offense intended to either Julian McMahon or Toby Kebbel, Fox never captured the brilliance of one of comic books’ finest felons. So whoever is hired for the gig has to be perfect. Names that have been floated around in the past include former supervillains <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cillian Murphy and Mads Mikkelsen</a>, but maybe what Marvel really needs to bring Doom back to life is to reflect how he believes he’s the hero of the story and cast a former superhero in the role.</p><p data-characters=48 data-current-count=48 data-injectable=false>Enter <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Henry Cavill</a></strong>? No, surely not… Right?</p><h2 id=h-henry-cavill-s-rumored-marvel-future-explained data-injectable=false>Henry Cavill’s rumored Marvel future, explained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Superman-angry.jpg><p data-characters=581 data-current-count=929 data-injectable=true>Marvel fans could’ve flown up, up, and away with excitement when a rogue tweet went viral over the weekend, claiming that Henry Cavill had been cast as Doom in The Fantastic Four. With Variety cited as a source, the news seemed legit! However, many were quick to realize that it was all a big prank and X (formerly Twitter) ultimately added a context warning to the tweet informing users that it was “fake news.” Yes, sorry, folks, but Cavill hasn’t been announced as the MCU’s Victor Von Doom. Well, maybe there’s a good reason for that…</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Henry Cavill will play Dr. Doom in Marvel’s ‘FANTASTIC FOUR’ film.</p><p>(Source: <a href=#>@Variety</a>) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZQUZGOhRfO</a></p>— Marvel News and Updates (@update_marvel) <a href=#>February 14, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=541 data-current-count=841 data-injectable=true>Here’s the thing, following the debunking of this totally bogus claim, self-styled scooper <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MyTimeToShineHello</a> then piped up to allege that Cavill won’t be Doctor Doom… because he’s secretly signed on with Marvel to play another unknown role. “He was offered something else and he accepted.” The rumor-rouser didn’t offer any further specifics, but in the face of another user accusing them of “lying,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MTTSH replied</a>, “You will find that I’m not, sooner than you think.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>He was offered something else and he accepted <a href=#>https://t.co/rtJcaqYBc1</a></p>— MyTimeToShineHello (@MyTimeToShineH) <a href=#>February 16, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=636 data-current-count=936 data-injectable=false>The result is that, no sooner had one rumor that Cavill had joined the MCU been snuffed out than another one rose up in its place. The big hope now is that The Witcher actor has swapped Superman to play Captain Britain, a character folks have been hankering for him to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">embody on the big screen for years now</a> (as the reams of fan art out there will tell you). So, yes, it isn’t Doom’s day just yet but it’s not the end of the world, Cavill collective, as there’s a (very) slim chance his time to team up with the Avengers will come. To misquote Russell Crowe in Man of Steel, in time he may join them in the sun.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxlmJq7s8WMnJivoZyheqSt0q1kmqtdmbykwM6rZJ2nn6J6qrqMrZ%2BeZZaWu7Wt0q2gnGWWpMKzew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-can-a-retired-person-earn-without-paying-taxes-in-2020.html><span>←</span><span>How much can a retired person earn without paying taxes in 2020?</span></a>
