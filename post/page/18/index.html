This 1964 song has been one of&nbsp;Marianne Faithfull‚Äòs greatest hits. But who would have thought that&nbsp; ‚ÄúAs Tears Go By‚Äù was a Rolling Stones original and a piece co-penned by Sir Mick Jagger? Well, indeed, it‚Äôs true! In 1995, Mick Jagger recalled the creation of this song. He stated,
‚ÄúI wrote the lyrics, and Keith wrote the melody. It‚Äôs a very melancholy song for a 21-year-old to write: The evening of the day, watching children play ‚Äì it‚Äôs very dumb and naive, but it‚Äôs got a very sad sort of thing about it, almost like an older person might write.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Media/HTPC Notebook: Sony EA series</h2><time>Aug 18, 2024</time>

Media/HTPC Notebook: Sony EA series
Our pick here was a complicated one. With the launch of the new Core i3/i5/i7 processors, any laptop with a basic Core i3 and Intel‚Äôs integrated HD Graphics solution had enough power to handle 1080p video playback and a standard HDMI output for connecting to an HDTV. Even adding the requirement of a Blu-ray drive (fair expectation in a notebook used for media playback) didn‚Äôt help much, since most 14‚Äùers from mainstream manufacturers like Dell, HP, and Sony have at least the option of a BD-ROM drive these days for not a whole lot of coin.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Paul Hollywood Net Worth; Check His Worth</h2><time>Aug 18, 2024</time>

High performance entertainment and gaming PCs are slowly but steadily increasing their presence into modern living rooms. This is largely attributed to the development of compact and powerful components that made small form factor (SFF) gaming PCs an affordable option. Although it is difficult to build a powerful gaming system as small as a gaming console, the development of aesthetically alluring SFF cases, in combination with the versatility and other advantages that PCs have, is turning them into a very serious competitor with gaming consoles.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Princess Mae Age, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Biography, Family &amp;amp; More</h2><time>Aug 18, 2024</time>
