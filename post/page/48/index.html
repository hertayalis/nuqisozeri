This story probably sounds made up, and if it wasn't being reported by the BBC, we'd probably think it was a movie pitch. It starts in 2013, when an anonymous mountain climber walked up to some French law enforcement officers and turned over a small box containing 100 precious jewels including rubies, emeralds, and sapphires worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $300,000, give or take.
He'd found it in the ice on Mont Blanc, and we know now the box came from an Air India flight that crashed on the mountain in January 1966.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Whats the difference between Big Brother and Survivor?</h2><time>Jul 12, 2024</time>

Recommended Videos Blue Mountain State: The Rise Of Thadland is a drug-fueled dystopian comedy that would make Rob Gronkowski blush – we’re coming out of the gate guns-blazing on&nbsp;this one!&nbsp;Everything that television audiences love about the hard-partying Mountain Goats makes a return in Lev L. Spiro’s&nbsp;spinoff film, as creators Eric Falconer and Romanski leave a trail&nbsp;of cocaine dust while they unleash&nbsp;epic, Thad-Castle-approved anarchy.
