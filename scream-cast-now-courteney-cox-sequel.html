My heart was racing. And I got really depressed. I went to the doctor and found out my hormones had been pummelled."</p><p>Since late 2013 she has been in a relationship with Snow Patrol's Johnny McDaid.</p><p>The actress also admitted she had gone too far with <a href=#>her plastic surgery</a> and ended up looking "strange" and like a different person as a result.</p><p>In 2017, she said: "I've had all my fillers dissolved.
