What a waste of time,’” she told&nbsp;<i>Glamour</i>&nbsp;in 2014. “That was the first and only thing he probably said to me the entire first year of working there.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>They eventually formed a friendship which turned romantic in late 2009. However, Molly admitted she was extremely hesitant about dating her boss. “I remember telling Jimmy, ‘If this doesn’t work out, nothing in your life changes, but mine changes completely,’” she previously told&nbsp;<i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Of course, things worked out, and they got hitched in June 2013.

I couldn’t ask for a better partner. I’m so happy we had this baby together. I’m definitely getting a vasectomy after this.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>It looks like Jimmy and Molly make a great team!</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn6hlmah6q7XMprBmo5miuqa40mauop6VYrqwuMuyZKabnpqus7rEsmSiq12dtrR50p6aqKaUYsCxu9SsnGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-heidi-funkee-bunch-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Heidi Funkee Bunch Dating Now</span></a>
