Stephen King has revealed that fellow bestselling author J.K. Rowling completely blocked him when he stood up for the trans community.
“Jo canceled me,” the 73-year-old horror-fiction legend told the Daily Beast of his spat with the Harry Potter author, whose full name is Joanne Kathleen Rowling.
“She sorta blocked me and all that,” he said of their Twitter tiff last June that even included Rowling deleting an earlier message of praise for him."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
